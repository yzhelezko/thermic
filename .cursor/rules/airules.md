- Always use command "wails dev" to test the app
- Add there only super important things, and only if user confirm that everthing is working good now it should be super short description here, just append new line if needed
- Always work with setupGlobalOutputListener() in terminal.js if you need to extend terminal features
- Profiles and folders now use ID-based references (FolderID, ParentFolderID)
- Sidebar save button uses only handleProfileSave() method - avoid duplicate event handlers to prevent multiple API calls
