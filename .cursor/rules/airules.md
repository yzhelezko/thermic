- Always use command "wails dev" to test the app
- Add there only super important things, and only if user confirm that everthing is working good now it should be super short description here, just append new line if needed
- Always work with setupGlobalOutputListener() in terminal.js if you need to extend terminal features
- Profiles and folders now use ID-based references (FolderID, ParentFolderID)
- Sidebar save button uses only handleProfileSave() method - avoid duplicate event handlers to prevent multiple API calls
- Use universal Modal component (components/Modal.js) for all dialogs - modal.confirm(), modal.confirmDelete(), modal.info(), modal.error()
- Use universal Notification component (components/Notification.js) for all notifications - notification.success(), notification.error(), notification.warning(), notification.info()
- Always use inline SVG icons (updateAllIconsToInline()) for proper day/night theme support - avoid img-based SVG icons
- Theme preference persists to config.yaml via GetTheme()/SetTheme() methods - both activity bar and settings toggles save to backend config
- Window controls are integrated into tabs titlebar - no separate header exists
- Settings panel slides from right, profile/folder panels slide from left, both have sidebar height and start below tabs
- macOS window controls: 12px size, 6px gap, positioned left with 8px padding, use window-control-close/minimize/maximize classes
- Windows/Linux controls: 46px width, 32px height, positioned right, use window-close/minimize/maximize classes
- macOS titlebar height: 28px, Windows/Linux: 32px, proper hover animations with scale(1.1) and brightness(0.9)
- Profile/folder renaming: saveProfileInternal/saveProfileFolderInternal automatically clean up old files to prevent duplicates with same ID
- Theme toggle icon: always pass explicit isDark parameter to updateThemeToggleIcon() to avoid race conditions in production builds
- Settings panel theme changes: must call terminalManager.updateTheme() and uiManager.onThemeChange() to update terminal output window
- SSH key discovery: scans entire .ssh directory for valid private keys when no keyPath specified (Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.ssh, Unix: $HOME/.ssh)
- App structure: Core functionality split into app_core.go (startup/shutdown/basic methods) and app.go (business logic) - maintain this separation
- Tab management: All tab-related functionality extracted to app_tabs.go (CreateTab, GetTabs, SetActiveTab, CloseTab, SSH connections, status management, reordering) - keep tab logic separate
- Profile management: All profile-related functionality extracted to app_profiles.go (CRUD operations, folder management, tree structure, virtual folders, search, metrics, API methods) - keep profile logic separate
- System monitoring: All system statistics and monitoring functionality extracted to app_system.go (local/remote system stats, CPU/memory/network monitoring, active tab info) - keep monitoring logic separate
- SFTP file explorer: All SFTP file operations extracted to app_sftp.go (InitializeFileExplorerSession, ListRemoteFiles, file upload/download, directory operations, file content management) - keep SFTP logic separate
